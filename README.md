# Objective
This project implements an Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning agent trained to play the Kung Fu Master Atari environment. The agent learns optimal policies through parallel training and environment interaction.
# Key Features
A3C architecture with actor–critic networks
Parallel agent training
Policy-based reinforcement learning
# Technologies
Python
Deep Reinforcement Learning
OpenAI Gym / Atari environment
